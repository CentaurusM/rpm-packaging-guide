// FIXME RENAME "General Topics and Background" TO "Preparing Source Code for Packaging" ?

// FIXME MOVE "ABSTRACT", "DOCUMENT CONVENTIONS", "PREREQUISITES", AND "CONTRIBUTING TO THIS GUIDE" TO A SEPARATE FILE - done (introduction.adoc)
// FIXME ADD "LEGAL NOTICE" BEFORE THE ABSTRACT - added, add the text of the legal notice

// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: MAKE MARKUP CONSISTENT, ESPECIALLY FOR TERMS
// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: MAKE TONE AND POINT OF VIEW CONSISTENT ("WE" VERSUS "YOU" AND SIMILAR) - We - in tutorial part, you - elsewhere?
// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: MAKE TERMS SPELLED CONSISTENTLY: RPM Packager, RPM Package, Binary RPM, Source RPM, AND SO ON

// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: MAKE SECTION NAMES MORE SPECIFIC
// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: MAKE SECTION NAMES ACTION-ORIENTED
// FIXME WHOLE GUIDE: ADD MORE STRUCTURE, ESPECIALLY FOR PROCEDURES

// FIXME RENAME GENERAL BACKGROUND AND RPM GUIDE CHAPTERS

The RPM Packaging Guide documents:

* How to prepare source code for packaging into an RPM. This is for people with no background in software development. See <<preparing-software.adoc#preparing-software-for-packaging>>.
* How to package source code into an RPM. This is for software developers who need to package software into RPMs. See <<packaging-software.adoc#packaging-software>>.
* Advanced packaging scenarios. This is for RPM packagers dealing with advanced RPM Packaging scenarios. See <<advanced-topics.adoc#advanced-topics>>.

// FIXME MAYBE MOVE THIS PARAGRAPH FROM THE ABSTRACT TO INTRODUCTION?
The <<preparing-software.adoc#preparing-software-for-packaging>> is a tutorial that
prepares people with no experience in software development to RPM Packaging. The
<<packaging-software.adoc#packaging-software>> is a tutorial that guides through basic
RPM Packaging. Follow both tutorials from beginning to end. The
<<advanced-topics.adoc#advanced-topics>> is reference material for information on RPM
Packaging beyond the basics.
