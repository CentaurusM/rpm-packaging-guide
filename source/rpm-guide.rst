RPM Packaging Guide
===================

Hello! Welcome to RPM Packaging 101 (for lack of a more inventive title). Here
you will find all of the information you need in order to start packaging RPMs
for various `Linux`_ Distributions that use the `RPM Package Format`_.

This guide assumes no previous knowledge about packaging software for any
Operating System, Linux or otherwise. However, it should be noted that this
guide is written to target the Red Hat "family" of Linux distributions, which
are:

* `Fedora`_
* `CentOS`_
* `Red Hat Enterprise Linux`_

While these distros are the target environment, it should be noted that lessions
learned here should be applicable across all distributions that are `RPM based`_.

.. note::
    If you have made it this far and don't know what a software package or a
    GNU/Linux distribution is, you might be best served by exploring some
    articles on the topics of `Linux`_ and `Package Managers`_.
